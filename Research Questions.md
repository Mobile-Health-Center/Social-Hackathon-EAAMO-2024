## EAAMO'24 Social Hackaton Research Questions

The EAAMO'24 Social Hackathon is motivated by new evidence and databases collected in Mexico on the relationship between environmental risk factors and breast cancer (BC). The Social Hackathon aims to explore how these data can be used to address the standing public health issues associated with this disease.

The implementation of BC national observatories has led to new findings emphasizing the importance of technological and environmental literacy for health specialists working with the communities and highlighting the relevance of developing effective local monitoring systems for data collection. Various open questions remain regarding the integration of this newfound evidence into the decision-making process of prevention strategies, virtual assistance systems, risk management schemes, prediction algorithms, and policy design. Some of the questions motivated by these findings are the following.

## Information Infrastructure

- How to collect informative databases?
- How to integrate databases?
- How to implement a pollutant release and transfer register?
- How to channel information to decision-makers?
- How to ensure access to data and incentivize social responsibility in data collection?

## Technology Literacy

- How to advance technological education in the region?
- How to create systems and databases that can be applied to local monitoring?

## Communicating Risk to Decision-Makers

- How to develop community and personal prevention strategies?
- How to train healthcare professionals in environmental topics or provide them with the necessary tools to integrate this dimension into their work?
- How to create simple technological tools for deploying virtual labs and virtual clinics that integrate with existing databases?
- What solution alternatives exist for major decision-makers, such as companies, to mitigate public health risks arising from environmental risk factors?
- What alternatives to a tax-based approach (e.g., green tax) exist?

## Prediction

- How to evaluate the effect of public health/ environmental interventions?
- How to predict BC incidence at fine grained geographical level?
- How to identify hotspots?
