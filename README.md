# <a name="_323rwzhtw6ca"></a>Call for Proposals: EAAMO Social Hackathon

We invite you to participate in the Social Hackathon, a key component of the ACM Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (EAAMO), to be held at the Autonomous University of San Luis Potosi (UASLP) in San Luis Potosi, Mexico on October 31, 2024. You can find the EAAMO call for paper [here](<https://conference.eaamo.org/cfp/>).


### <a name="_l6pkwa85qv71"></a>The Social Hackathon Vision
The Social Hackathon is more than a competition—it’s a call to action for the EAAMO community. This initiative is designed to harness the power of algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design, coupled with insights from the social sciences and humanistic studies, to tackle pressing social issues. Local partners provide curated datasets and extensive context on these issues, aiming to incorporate insights from impacted communities and policymakers. The goal is to create practical tools that bridge the research-to-practice pipeline. Winning teams will continue collaborating with policymakers to refine and implement their solutions.
### <a name="_tkxla2g6zhbb"></a>This Year’s Challenge: Breast Cancer in Mexico

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in Mexico, accounting for 30% of malignant neoplasia. In 2020, The incidence rate was 40.5 per 100,000 inhabitants in the country, with an age-adjusted incidence of 49.3 per 100,000 reported in Merida alone in 2022. Established risk factors explain up to 70% of postmenopausal breast cancer cases in the US, but only one-third can be prevented by modifying lifestyle factors such as weight, hormone therapy, alcohol use, and physical activity.

Health equity studies in Mexico found significant links between education level, socioeconomic status, and breast cancer prognosis. Environmental exposure to carcinogens and endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) also contributes to breast cancer risk. While lifestyle changes and the built environment impact risk factors like excess body weight, physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, delayed childbearing, fewer childbirths, and not breastfeeding, they do not fully explain the rise in breast cancer cases.

Emerging evidence shows that air pollution, classified as a carcinogen, may increase breast cancer risk through genetic mutations and increased breast density. Heavy metals like lead, mercury, arsenic, and cadmium, found in air pollution, act as xenoestrogens and carcinogens, particularly affecting high-risk, low-income populations with limited healthcare access.

Understanding the impact of these environmental risk factors on breast cancer mortality, especially in underserved communities, is crucial. Novel approaches are needed to develop evidence-based public health decisions that address environmental exposures, social risk, healthcare access, and breast cancer mortality surveillance.
### <a name="_k7lpz17fki4n"></a>Broad-Level Goals
For this year's Social Hackathon, we are honored to collaborate with Professor Jacqueline Calderon from the Medical School of UASLP and a visiting professor at Boston College. Professor Calderon has curated a comprehensive dataset that includes geotagged rates of environmental contaminants (air pollution, lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and water pollution), along with breast cancer incidence rates in San Luis Potosi and across Mexico. The broad goals of this hackathon are:

1\. **Understanding Disparities**: Extend our understanding of the relationship between breast cancer mortality, environmental carcinogens, healthcare, and social disparities among Mexican women.

2\. **Creating Dynamic Surveillance Platforms**: Develop a platform for storing, sharing, and analyzing unified databases to identify populations at high risk of breast cancer mortality due to aggregated and cumulative environmental hazards, healthcare infrastructure, and social disadvantages.

3\. **Nurturing Digital Ecosystems**: Create a digital ecosystem to visualize temporal and spatial trends at different geographical levels, monitor and predict breast cancer disparities, and provide evidence for decision-makers to strengthen the healthcare system.

4\. **Enhancing Technical Capabilities**: Enhance technical capabilities by incorporating cutting-edge technologies to update the healthcare system and provide expert training and support.
### <a name="_e7fk27cqg1fb"></a>Specific Goals
**Priority 1—Improve Public Health Decisions**: Develop novel surveillance systems incorporating algorithms to identify high-risk populations and characterize environmental carcinogen hazards, medical infrastructure, and social environments.

**Priority 2—Reduce Barriers to Healthcare**: Improve healthcare access by creating bridges between individuals most in need and healthcare facilities.

**Priority 3—Risk Tools**: Enhance breast cancer risk estimation by incorporating environmental carcinogen risks, healthcare access, and social hazards into risk tools, such as the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool by the NCI.

**Priority 4—Science Education**: Develop digital tools to translate scientific evidence regarding breast cancer for individuals, communities, and public policy, improving public health decision-making.
