**Location:** San Luis Potosí, SLP Mexico  
**Venue:** Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí 
**Registration Deadline:** September 1, 2024

## Overview

Breast cancer is a significant global health issue, being the most common cancer among women and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Worldwide, it accounts for about 25% of all cancer cases and 15% of cancer deaths among women. Risk factors include genetic predisposition, lifestyle choices, and environmental factors. Early detection through screening and advancements in treatment have improved survival rates, but disparities in healthcare access continue to affect outcomes, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

In Mexico, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and the leading cause of cancer deaths in women aged 25 and older. The incidence has been rising, with late-stage diagnosis being a significant challenge due to limited access to screening and healthcare services. Cultural factors, lack of awareness, and socioeconomic barriers also contribute to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Efforts are being made to enhance early detection, improve treatment options, and increase public awareness to combat the rising burden of breast cancer in Mexico.
