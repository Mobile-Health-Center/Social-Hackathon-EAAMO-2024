### Identifying the problem/need:
- Has the team identified the problem in accordance with the theme of the social hackathon?
- How well has the team identified and addressed the needs of the impacted communities in their solution?
- Is there a real need for the proposed solution for decision- and policy-makers?
- Have the target groups, particularly impacted communities, been properly identified, explained, and addressed?
- Has the team incorporated an interdisciplinary approach in their solution? Does the solution integrate knowledge and techniques from multiple fields such as healthcare, technology, social sciences, and environmental studies?

### Applicability/feasibility of the solution:
- Does the proposed solution by the team address the targeted problem of breast cancer disparities in Mexico?
- Does the solution align with the goals of understanding disparities, creating dynamic surveillance platforms, fostering digital ecosystems, and enhancing technical capabilities?
- Is the proposed solution realistically usable, and does it have the potential to be developed and put into use to benefit the impacted communities?

#### Technical aspects of the software solution:
- Has the team adequately explained the stack of technologies used in the solution?
- Are they compatible with each other? How easy is to implement them in a real-world system? Usage of open source and free of charge tools is encouraged.
- Are the technologies cutting-edge and capable of upgrading the health system and providing expert training and support?

### Functionality of the software solution:
- Does it really solve the problem it was made for, particularly within the context of breast cancer in Mexico?
- Does it contain the necessary functionalities, and how are they implemented to address the identified disparities and enhance technical capabilities?
- Does it meet the needs of the final user (i.e. decision- and policy-makers)?
- Does the solution provide tangible benefits to the communities most affected by breast cancer disparities in Mexico?

### Presentation (within the provided ten minutes long video and documentation):
- Has the team clearly, professionally, and comprehensibly presented their solution? More specifically, the video and the documents should have descriptions, demonstrated, and explanations to previously stated points: 
    1. Identifying the problem/need, 
    2.  Applicability/feasibility of the solution,
    3. Technical aspects of the software solution, and 4) Functionality of the software solution.
    
- Did the presentation effectively convey how the solution addresses the hackathon's goals?
